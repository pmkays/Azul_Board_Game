The majority of the functionality remains the same as the original mode with the exception of 4 players and the 2 central factories which required an extra command. 
Therefore, in my opinion it would be best to test this added functionality and mainly if full games work, as it would be redundant to retest functionality that was not altered from the original mode e.g. broken tile movements, point scoring, etc.
