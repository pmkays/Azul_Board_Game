The majority of the functionality remains the same as the original mode with the exception of 4 players. 
Therefore, in my opinion it would be best to test if a turn, round and mainly full games work, as it would be redundant to retest functionality that was not altered from the original mode e.g. broken tile movements, point scoring, etc.
